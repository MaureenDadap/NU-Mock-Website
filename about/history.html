              A young man, barely 23 years old, had a vision of inculcating
              among the youth the qualities of competence and leadership, high
              moral and spiritual values and development of each individual into
              a total person. These would be acquired through an educational
              process guided by the philosophy of Dynamic Filipinism.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>
                "This philosophy has as its guiding tenets, the internalizing
                all that is good in the Filipino people: warmth, hospitality ,
                innovativeness , and a high emotional quotient that has made
                Filipinos renowned in service oriented industries.”
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This young man , Don Mariano Fortunato Jhocson , guided by this
              vision , founded Colegio Filipino , now NATIONAL UNIVERSITY in
              August 01 , 1900 , in Quiapo, City of Manila . It was the first
              non – sectarian and co – educational institution then. There were
              only a handful of students at that time in the fledgling School,
              and they were in the elementary and secondary (High School)
              levels. Don Mariano, in order to help the school grow, was
              teacher, director and janitor rolled into one.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a short span of 5 years, he offered courses in Business –
              bookkeeping and accounting, convinced that thus armed, his
              students would be financially secure and respectable after
              graduation. This led to the changing of the name to Colegio
              Mercantil , awarding the diploma of Perito Mercantil . A short
              time later, the Philippine Law School was opened with the
              collaboration of the Lacson brothers. Don Mariano saw the dire
              need for training the youth for leadership and responsibility. He
              firmly believed that the discipline of Law would turn out men and
              women who would eventually be advocates for Philippine self
              government.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1916, the Board of Trustees changed the name from Colegio
              Mercantil to National Academy. The growth of the Academy was
              continuous, added Liberal Arts which became the gateway to other
              disciplines that followed.
            </p>
            <p>
              After 21 years of educational service, on January 17, 1921, the
              Board of Trustees applied for and secured permission from the
              Department of Public Instruction to change the name of the
              National Academy to NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. On that same day, the
              University also installed Senator Camilo Osias , one of the most
              respected and outstanding Filipino educators as President of the
              University.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thereafter, the Colleges of Education and Commerce were opened in
              the same year. During the following years, the Colleges of
              Pharmacy and Dentistry were opened in 1922. The College of
              Engineering, offering initially Civil Engineering opened in 1925
              and the Normal School in 1930. Sanitary Engineering was initially
              offered in 1930.
            </p>
            <p>
              From July, 1945 its facilities have since continuously expanded
              and the following disciplines were added – Bachelor degrees in
              Chemical, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical Engineering and
              Architecture and Arts. Master in Sanitery Engineering was also
              organized.
            </p>
            <p>
              Responding to the needs of industry and modern technology, the
              University started offering the following courses: Computer
              Science in 1990, Marine Engineering and in 1994 Computer
              Engineering and Electronics and Communications Engineering.
              College of Nursing was offered in 2004, Hotel and Restaurant
              Management in 2008 and Information Technology in 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
              On January 01, 1998, a disastrous fire razed four buildings of the
              University – the Main Building, Law and Commerce Building,
              Elementary Building and the Graduate School Building. The
              University was able to re-open its doors after three weeks of
              unrelenting restoration work.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the last quarter of year 2008, the SM Group of Companies
              acquired majority ownership of the National University. The all
              out support of the SM Group will help strengthen our institution
              as Higher Institution with new infrastructure, improved and
              upgraded laboratory, focused in academic excellence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, the University is engaged in a continuous modernization and
              upgrading program for its facilities, faculty and sports
              development.Our new University infrastructure is an 8 storey
              modern design building with two units of escalators and four units
              of elevators.
            </p>
